Project Description: A project requiring an implementation of the C standard library Printf function.
Our function will in its current state only handle the following cases: %d, %i, %s, %c, %% and a normally passed string to the function.
Our function is made up of the following files:
1. Master_func: This contains the main function, which outputs the string or subjects it to a format controllers.
2. Charadd: Uses the write function to implement a char printing function.
3. intadd: Handles the i or d specifiers.
4. memadd: Outputs the content of our created memory.
Contributers: Botshelo Banda and Ayabulela Mkhwanazi.
