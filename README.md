Project Description: A project requiring an implementation of the C standard library Printf function.
Our function will in its current state only handle the following cases: %d, %i, %s, %c, %% and a normally passed string to the function.
Our function is made up of the following files:
1. Master_func: This contains the function, which outputs the string or subjects it to a format.
2. Charout: Uses the write function to implement a char printing function.
3. func_det: Conatins two handler functions for c and s.
4. func_dets: Conatins two handler functions for % and i or d.
